# Home Assistant

Project topic: [Public](https://t.me/c/1733231297/14791)/[Private](https://t.me/c/1900643629/3395)

## Description

In hackerspace, we have a lot of "smart"-ish devices. To make them more smart, we need to make them work together. That's where [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) comes in. It allows any device to integrate with central HomeAssistant installation. This way, HomeAssistant can be the central dashboard and a place for automations to run.

## Integrations

Currently there are these integrations configured:
| Integration | Description |
|--|--|
| ESPHome | Temp/Humidity/CO2 sensors on ESP controllers with ESPHome firmware |
| HACS | [Custom integration](https://hacs.xyz/) that provides auto-updates for other custom integration |
| Mikrotik | Used for device tracking by DHCP |
| WLED | Devices running [WLED](https://kno.wled.ge/) like LED strip and [Bottle display](https://wiki.f0rth.space/en/Projects/bottledisplay) |
| ZHA (ZigBee Home Automation) | ZigBee integration, controls ZigBee network via XiaomiGateway3 |
