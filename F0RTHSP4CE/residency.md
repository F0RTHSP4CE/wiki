We invite you to join hackspace residency!

Residents are active members of the hackspace, making decisions together, developing the space and supporting it financially. Collective decisions are not easy, so we try to follow democracy patterns: https://wiki.hackerspaces.org/The_Democracy_Pattern. Meetings are held every Tuesday (classic). Also, residents have free access to the space.
 
The minimum residence fee is $42 per month, but $100 or more is welcomed. 

If you're interested, please PM any resident with some info about yourself, your message will be forwarded to the internal hackspace chat.
