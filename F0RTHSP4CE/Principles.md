## Principles

Basic principles of our community are:

1.  **Be brilliant to each other**  
    Listen to each other's needs and opinions.
2.  **Do not oppress and do not bother**   
    Be wary of personal boundaries, be ready to make compromises.
3.  **Give more than you take**  
    F0RTHSP4CE can grow only if the community makes it better. We are not a co-working per se, so we are all the ones who make the workspaces for each other.
4.  **Financial independence**  
    F0RTHSP4CE is not a start-up, resident is a resident and you can't buy more voting power with donations.
5.  **Do-ocracy**  
    If you want to change something, do it, but bear in mind the needs of the others.
6.  **Dying is strictly forbidden**  
    Safety first. Follow the rules and help the others.

## Rules

### Photo and Videography

-   **Ask before taking photos**. People may not want to be photographed, respect their boundaries.
-   **Be careful with the publication of photos** of personal belongings and projects (projects may be under NDA, notebooks may contain personal notes, and laptop screens may display passwords).
-   In exceptional situations (when capturing an unreproducible dynamic action is necessary), you can **first take the photo, then immediately ask everyone** and delete it if someone is not okay with it.
