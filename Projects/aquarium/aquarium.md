## Summary

A freshwater aquarium stands at the entrance to the hackerspace and delights visitors.
The fish are fed automatically at 12:00 and 20:00 every day.
The plant light operates on a timer from 17:00 to 23:00.
To prevent the fish from dying, the water is filtered through a large filter with a sponge.
The water temperature is maintained by a thermostat.
Carbon dioxide is supplied to the aquarium to accelerate plant growth.
