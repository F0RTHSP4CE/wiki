# F0 chat Code of Conduct

To add more transparency to our chat policy we would like to introduce the following code of conduct:

#### You will have your account banned from F0 chat for the following actions:

* Spam (e.g. dating sites, ponzi schemes, DOS). 
* Pornography, gore, violent materials. 
* Aggressive behavior towards any group of people, or individuals. This does not include constructive criticism.
* Political discussions.

#### The following posts are going to be deleted:

* Posts for which an account was banned.

* Commercial offers, excluding flea market (selling your diy synth for friendly price is Okay ✅, selling your crypto stock signals is Not okay❌)

* Self-promoting and other forms of advertising made out of any relatable chat/hackerspace context (e.g. sharing your GitHub pet-project link while discussing a particular topic or when asking for help is Okay ✅, posting your Instagram account link as a first message right after joining chat is Not okay ❌)

* Event announcements which were not approved.

### How to approve an announcement

DM any resident (they have "resident" label in chat) and wait for the decision (about 1 day). Events somehow connected to hackerspace topics are welcome.

Please note that every hackerspace event requires at least one resident responsible for opening and closing hackerspace and for resolving any possible issues happening during event. It's up to you to communicate residents into getting interested about your particular event and hence helping you.

Each case of ban/message deletion is discussed and thoroughly researched by residents except for messages from bot accounts and illegal content which is banned right away.

**General rule: stay brilliant to each other!**

p.s. please use English in `[EN]` topics
